#Calculate Distance: Using the Haversine formula, determine the distance between two given geo-locations.

#Calculate Delivery Time: Combine the distance calculation with the average speed to estimate the time it would take to deliver an order from a restaurant to a consumer, considering the preparation time at the restaurant.

#Find Optimal Path: For each restaurant, calculate the total delivery time for both orders. Then, compare the total delivery times from each restaurant and choose the one with the shortest time as the optimal path.

This approach efficiently determines the best way for a delivery executive to complete a batch of orders in the shortest possible time.
